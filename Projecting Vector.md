Orthogoanality : It is tool for decomposing bojects into combinations of simpler objects in a structured way.

To find the Projecting Vector
1. Take a vector b and imagine a line 'l' through the origin that contains the vector b. 
2. Now let a vector v is at some angle from vector b.

Now there are two ways to find this Projecting Vector.

1. Let v emanate from the origin and then imagine rotating your point of view until you are looking at b and v in the same plane. Then measure the apparent magnitude of the arrow v from this point of view.
Unless v and b are perfectly parallel, v will look shorter than it actually is.
The shorter arrow is the projection of v onto b. It can be represented as proj sub b (v), or with two little bars next to it for short.

2. Another way is to describe projection is to draw a right triangle whose hypotenuse is the arroe depicting v and one of whose legs lies on the line l. The vector between the origin and right angle is projection of v onto b.
The other leg is orthogonal to vector b.

As the Vector v is sum of two vectors thus it can be shown as : v = v parallel + v perp. It is shown in image Projection.

Two images show the relationship between the vector and projection vector in images Projecting Vectors 1 & 2.
