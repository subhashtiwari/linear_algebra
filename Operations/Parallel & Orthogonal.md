Two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar mutiple of the other.
If V is a vector than it is parallel to 2V, .5V, -V etc. 

Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is 0.
The product 0 signify two things : 
1. Either one of the vector is a zero vector.
2. They are at right angle to each other. 

0 vector is parallel and orthogonal to all other vectors. It is the only vector that is orthogonal to itself.
