It is another form of vector multiplication.
It only exists in three dimensions.

Geometrically cross product of two vectors equals to the product of the magnitude of the two vectors times the sine theta, where theta is the angle between v and w.
Its output is a vector.

If  the angle between two vectors is either 0 or 180 degrees there cross product will be zero.
If the product is zero then the vectors are parallel.

To determine the direction we use right-hand rule. Then if the cross product is v cross w, imagine your right thumb pointing in the direction of v and your right index finger in the direction of w. 
Then extend your right middle finger and then the direction it points will be the direction of the cross w.
If we switch the order of the cross product to w cross v, then according to the right-hand rule will give us the downward pointing vector.

Thus vxw = -(wxv). Thus it is called anticommutative in which switching the order does not affect the product.

The area of the paralleogram = base times height = ||v|| ||w|| sin0.

The formula for cross product is shown in image Cross product with an example.
We can confirm the result by doing the dot product with either one of the vector as it is orthogonal to both the vector and the result of dot product will be zero.

Write the code for the problem shown in image ProblemCross.
