To multiply two vectors we do Inner product ( Dot Product ).
It can be represented by palcing a dot between two vectors.
It helps us in finding the angle between two different vectors.
It is equals to product of the magnitude of two vectors and to the cosine of the theta, where theta is the angle between the vectors v and w.

The result of inner product is a number, not a vector.

There are some assumptions which give immediate results.
1. If neither v nor w is zero vector, then if we get the dot product of two equals to the product of the magnitude of the two. It means that we have cosine of theta = 1 i.e. the theta = 0. That implies that both the vectors are in a line and in same direction.

2. If neither v nor w is zero vector, then if we get the dot product of two equals to the negative of the product of the magnitude of the two. It concludes that the cosine of theta equals to -1 and theta = 180 degrees. That implies that the two vectors are in a line but in opposite direction.

3. If we get the dot product = 0, this means that the angle between the two vectors is 90 degrees or theta = 90 degrees.

4. When we take the dot product of a vector with itself, the angle between them is 0 both in radians and in degrees. This turns out to be the square of the magnitude of the vector.

Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

In this inequality it is shown that the dot product of two vectors will have a Interval ( -||V|| x ||W|| , ||V|| x ||W|| ).
This when expressed in form of inequality is called as Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. It is shown in image Inequality.

Now write a code to find the output of the following problems shown in image Dot Product.
