An Intersection is where two or more lines meet each other at a common point. This point satisfies all the equations. 

A line is defined by two things
- Basepoint : It can be any point through which it passes. It is represented by x naught.
- Direction Vector : It is a vector that gives the direction of the line. It is represented by v.

All points on the line can be represented in form of t equals x naught plus t times v. Thus we can plot a line by putting different values of t in the equation.

For a line in two dimensions we have a general equation : Ax + By = k

For the Basepoint :
- if B not equals to 0 : take x=0 to get y = k/B    (0 , k/B)
- if A not equal to 0 : take y=0 t get x = k/A      (k/A , 0)

To get the direction vector

(x,y) on Ax+By = 0 implies that the line is orthogonal to the vector AB.

For point (B,-A) will give a direction vector fro this line.

By changing the value of k we shift the line away or towards the origin, but it does not change the direction of the line at all.

- Two lines in 2D are parallel if their normal vector are parallel vectors. For higher dimensions there can be more than one direction vector.

If two lines are not parallel then they will intersect each other at a single point.
Whereas, if two lines are parallel then they will not intersect at all, or they have infinitely many intersections i.e. they are overlapped or are called as coincident lines.

- Two parallel lines are equal if and only if the vector connecting one point on each line is orthogonal to the lines' normal vectors.

- If two lines are not parallel then we need to find their intersection point.
Let take two lines in their Standard Form

Ax + By = k1
Cx + Dy = k2

To find their intersection point follow steps.

1. Divide the equation 1 by A.
2. Subtract C times the equation 1 from equation 2. After solving the equation we will get the equation in y only. 
 
Solve for y. 
If we assume AD - BC = 0, we get two vectors A,B(it is pnormal to first line) and D,-C(it is parallel to second line).
But this shows that the two lines are parallel which is false so the assumption is false.

3. So we divide the second equation by (AD - BC)

4. Subtract B/A times equation 2 from equation 1. And after solving we get the Intersection Point where x = (Dk1-Bk2)/(AD-BC)
                             y = (-Ck1+Ak2)/(AD-BC)
