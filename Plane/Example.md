It is an example to get the algorithm to solve the equation.

The three equations are

 x - 3y  + z = 4
-3x + 9y + z = 12
       y - z = 1


Operations Used:
1. Add 3xEq.1 to Eq.2.        So Eq.2 becomes : 4z = 12

2. Swap Eq.2 and Eq.3.        So, New Order :  x - 3 + z = 4
                                                   y - z = 1
                                                      4z = 12
We get a triangular form or row echelon form.

3. Multiply Eq.3 by 1/4.       So, Eq.3 becomes : z = 3                                                 
4. Add Eq.3 to Eq.2.           So, Eq.2 becomes : y = 4

5. Add -1xEq.3 to Eq.1.        So, Eq.1 becomes : x -3y = 1

6. Add 3xEq.2 to Eq.1.         So, Eq.1 becomes : x = 13

So the intersection point is (14,4,3)

This meathod is called as Gaussian Elimination Method.


Another Example have eqations as follows:

-x + y + z = -2
x - 4z + 4z = 21
7x - 5y - 11z = 0

After solving by following Gaussian Elimination the Intersection Point is (1, -3, 2)
