1. A system is inconsistent if and only if we find 0 = k for k nonzero during Gaussian Elimination.

2. Not enough to count number of equations (usually) or look for 0 = 0 to determine if infinitely many solutions.

3. A consistent syatem has a unique solution if and only if each variable is a pivot variable.

4. Number of free variables = dimensions of solution set.
